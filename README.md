# CalculatorThing
A calculator I made in C# during the first year of college, not too crazy because I had not coded before hand

It allows for multiple calculations in a single go but only does them in the order they were entered, not following the order of operations.
It shows the history of your calculations on the right because I wanted it to be similar to the windows calculator in that way, sadly it is not very advanced and only 
the basic operations can be used. I like to think it is an ok project for a (somewhat) first-time programmer although this was at the end of my 2nd programming class (first was c++, no final there)
